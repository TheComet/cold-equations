\section{Cold Equations - Alternate Ending}

``Good-by, Gerry.''
Faint and ineffably poignant and tender, the last words came from the cold metal
of the communicator:
``Good-bby, little sister--''

She sat motionless in the hush  that  followed,  as  thought  listening  to  the
shadow-echoes of the  words  as  they  died  away, then she turned away from the
communicator, toward the air lock, and he pulled the black lever beside him. The
inner  door of the air lock slid swiftly open, to reveal the  bare  little  cell
that was waiting for her.

``Wait, is this  really  the  end?''  Marilyn whispered, tears welling up in her
eyes.  Barton  looked  at  her  long  and  hard, contemplaiting, calculating.
``Actually, there is  another option.'' Marilyn looked up with hope in her eyes.
``We have got to make the ship lighter somehow, and we have  to do it fast if we
want to avoid the \textbf{inevitable}.''

Quickly, they \textbf{scatter}, looking for anything that could be affordable to
lose. The ship is barren, safe for a small toolbox.

\section{Cold Equations - Alternate Ending}

``Good-by, Gerry.''
Faint and ineffably poignant and tender, the last words came from the cold metal
of the communicator:
``Good-bby, little sister--''

She sat motionless in the hush  that  followed,  as  thought  listening  to  the
shadow-echoes of the  words  as  they  died  away, then she turned away from the
communicator, toward the air lock, and he pulled the black lever beside him. The
inner  door of the air lock slid swiftly open, to reveal the  bare  little  cell
that was waiting for her.

``Wait, is this  really  the  end?''  Marilyn whispered, tears welling up in her
eyes.  Barton  looked  at  her  long  and  hard, contemplaiting, calculating.
``Actually, there is  another option.'' Marilyn looked up with hope in her eyes.
``We have got to make the ship lighter somehow, and we have  to do it fast if we
want to avoid the \textbf{inevitable}.''

Quickly, they \textbf{scatter}, looking for anything that could be affordable to
lose, but the ship was devoid of all objects safe for the freight. Marilyn found
a  small toolbox hidden beneath the captain's chair and was about to lob it into
the airlock when Barton \textbf{intervened}.
``Wait,   there   might   be  tools  we  can  use  to  take  my  chair   apart''

They \textbf{pored over} the  toolbox,  emptying  its  contents out all over the
floor. Their hopes dropped as  fast  as  they  rose -- The only thing inside the
toolbox was a \textbf{thin}, rusty old saw blade.

Barton \textbf{cussed} loudly. Stardust had absolutely nothing disposable in it.
It was just\ldots empty. More \textbf{hollow} than a feminist's brain in America
in the year 2015.

Marilyn  and  Barton  shared  a moment of  \textbf{mutual}  frustration  when  a
horrible idea struct Marilyn.

``There's yet another way.'' she said slowly, \textbf{dubiously}.
``What way would that be?'' Barton asked.

Marilyn didn't take her eyes off of the saw blade.
